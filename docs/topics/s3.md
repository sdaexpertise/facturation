The Odoo filestore is mirrored in a S3 bucket. Enabling Odooku to use S3
requires that the Dyno's have access to the AWS credentials as well as the
name of the bucket to store files.

Odooku exposes 3 environment variables that need to be configured:

```
$ heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_key>
$ heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret>
$ heroku config:set AWS_REGION=<your_aws_region>
$ heroku config:set S3_BUCKET=<your_s3_bucket_name>
```

Your S3 credentials can be found on the Security Credentials section of the
AWS “My Account/Console” menu.
